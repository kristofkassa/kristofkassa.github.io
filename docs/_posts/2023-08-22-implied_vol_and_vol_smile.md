### Introduction

The volatility smile is a pivotal concept. Understanding it is not just an academic endeavor; it can shape trading and hedging strategies in the real world. In this post, we will demystify the construction of the volatility smile, employing data from Yahoo Finance's option chains.

Yahoo Finance offers a treasure trove of data on exchange-traded options, both calls and puts, for an underlying stock. What is particularly interesting for us is that it provides the Black-Scholes implied volatility for varying options and strikes. This data will be instrumental throughout later, especially when calibrating models to market data.

### Step 1: Delving into Volatility Data

Before diving in, let's set up our Python environment:

```python
from datetime import date
import yahoo_fin.stock_info as si
from yahoo_fin import options
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Now, let's extract the options chain data for a specific stock. Here, we'll use IBM as an example:

```python
Mat = date(2023, 9, 29)
T = Mat - date.today()
ticker = "IBM"
chain = options.get_options_chain(ticker, Mat)
price = si.get_live_price(ticker)
callData = chain["calls"]
putData = chain["puts"]
callData.head(15)
```

In the following example, we have selected the firm IBM and will plot its volatility smile. You will have to fill in by hand the maturity date, `Mat`, in the code, in order to properly extract the data. [You can consult the maturity you want to use here.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/options?p=IBM)

Then, you should fill in the `Mat` variable in the space given, following the form YYYY-MM-DD.

```python

```

When choosing the stock, it's advisable to consider:

- Stocks with a high volume of exchange-traded options tend to have more robust volatility smiles.
- The ideal maturity for option contracts shouldn't be too far in the future nor too close. A ballpark range would be around t+3 months.
- Ensure you select the exact date of the option's expiration.

Now, let's visualize the implied volatility smile:

```python
df_call = callData
df_call["Implied Volatility"] = df_call["Implied Volatility"].str[:-1].astype(float)
df_call = df_call[df_call["Implied Volatility"] > 0]
df_call["Strike"] = df_call["Strike"].astype(float)
df_call = df_call[(df_call["Strike"] > price * 0.8) & (df_call["Strike"] < price * 1.2)]
df_call.plot(kind="scatter", x="Strike", y="Implied Volatility", color="red")
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

The visual might reveal not a complete smile but a smirk or skew, a phenomenon primarily arising due to increased demand for near ATM options and put options as crash hedges.

### Step 2: The Newton-Raphson Method for Implied Volatility

While Yahoo Finance provides implied volatility, there's value in understanding its derivation. The Newton-Raphson method is a popular iterative approach to this:

The Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that seeks to find successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.

First, let's set up our mathematical tools:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

N_prime = norm.pdf
N = norm.cdf
```

Now, we'll define the Black-Scholes pricing formula for a call option:

```python
def black_scholes_call(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    d1 = (np.log(S / K) + (r + sigma**2 / 2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    return S * N(d1) - N(d2) * K * np.exp(-r * T)
```

We also need the vega of the option:

```python
def vega(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    d1 = (np.log(S / K) + (r + sigma**2 / 2) * T) / sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    return S * np.sqrt(T) * N_prime(d1)
```

Lastly, our Newton-Raphson-based function for computing implied volatility:

```python
def implied_volatility_call(C, S, K, T, r, tol=0.0001, max_iterations=100):
    sigma = 0.3
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        diff = black_scholes_call(S, K, T, r, sigma) - C
        if abs(diff) < tol:
            return sigma
        sigma = sigma - diff / vega(S, K, T, r, sigma)
    return sigma

found on 2th iteration
difference is equal to -7.274655111189077e-06
Implied volatility using Newton Rapshon is:  0.5428424065162358
```

You can check the performance of this algorithm against some of the existing (freely available) online implied volatility calculators. For example, [you can check this site.](http://www.option-price.com/implied-volatility.php)

Now you know a simple way to extract implied volatility from option market prices.
