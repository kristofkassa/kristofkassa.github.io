## Introduction

We start dealing with stochastic volatility models. Specifically, we will implement the Monte-Carlo simulation of the Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model.

The Heston Stochastic Volatility Model is a mathematical model that aims to capture the evolution of an asset's price and its associated volatility over time. Unlike the Black-Scholes model, which assumes constant volatility, the Heston model allows for time-varying volatility by modeling it as a stochastic process. This makes it a more flexible and realistic tool for option pricing and risk management.

### Formula
The Heston model describes two stochastic differential equations (SDEs):

1. For the asset price $ S(t) $:

$$
dS(t) = \mu S(t) dt + \sqrt{V(t)} S(t) dW_1(t)
$$

2. For the volatility $ V(t) $:

$$
dV(t) = \kappa (\theta - V(t)) dt + \xi \sqrt{V(t)} dW_2(t)
$$

Where:
- $ \mu $ = Risk-free rate
- $ S(t) $ = Asset price at time $ t $
- $ V(t) $ = Volatility at time $ t $
- $ dW_1(t), dW_2(t) $ = Wiener processes, potentially correlated with correlation coefficient $ \rho $
- $ \kappa $ = Rate at which $ V(t) $ reverts to $ \theta $
- $ \theta $ = Long-term mean of the volatility process
- $ \xi $ = Volatility of volatility

### Key Concepts
1. **Stochastic Volatility**: Unlike constant volatility models like Black-Scholes, the Heston model allows volatility to be a random function of time.
  
2. **Mean Reversion**: The model includes a mean-reversion term ($ \kappa (\theta - V(t)) $), which makes the volatility revert to a long-term mean ($ \theta $) over time.
  
3. **Volatility of Volatility**: The Heston model accounts for the "volatility of volatility" through the $ \xi $ term, allowing the model to capture the "smile" or "skew" in the implied volatility surface.

4. **Correlation**: The model also includes a term ($ \rho $) to capture the correlation between the asset price and its volatility.

To simulate these continuous-time processes, you often need to discretize them. This is done to approximate the changes in the asset price and volatility over small periods of time. A common method of discretization is the Euler-Maruyama scheme.

### Discretization Using Euler-Maruyama Scheme

Euler-Maruyama is a numerical method used for approximating solutions to SDEs. In this scheme, a continuous-time stochastic process is approximated over discrete time intervals of length $ dt $. The scheme transforms the original continuous-time SDEs into the discrete-time formulas you presented.

#### Asset Price $ S_t $
$$
S_t = S_{t-1} e^{\left( r - \frac{\nu_t}{2} \right) dt + \sqrt{\nu_t} dZ_1 \sqrt{dt}}
$$
Here, $ r $ is the risk-free rate, $ \nu_t $ is the volatility at time $ t $, $ dt $ is the time step, and $ dZ_1 $ is a sample from a standard normal distribution. The term $ e^{\left( r - \frac{\nu_t}{2} \right) dt} $ is the drift term, and $ \sqrt{\nu_t} dZ_1 \sqrt{dt} $ is the stochastic term.

#### Volatility $ \nu_t $
$$
\nu_t = \nu_{t-1} + \kappa \left( \theta - \nu_{t-1} \right) dt + \xi \sqrt{\nu_{t-1}} dZ_2 \sqrt{dt}
$$
Here, $ \kappa $ is the rate at which volatility reverts to the long-term mean $ \theta $, $ \xi $ is the volatility of volatility, and $ dZ_2 $ is another sample from a standard normal distribution.

These formulas allow you to simulate $ S_t $ and $ \nu_t $ iteratively over a sequence of discrete time steps, thus providing a numerical approximation to the Heston model's continuous-time behavior.

As usual, let's start by importing the necessary libraries.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as ss
```

We will start by coding the stochastic volatility function,  ùúàùë°: 

```python
def SDE_vol(v0, kappa, theta, sigma, T, M, Ite, rand, row, cho_matrix):
    dt = T / M  # T = maturity, M = number of time steps
    v = np.zeros((M + 1, Ite), dtype=np.float)
    v[0] = v0
    sdt = np.sqrt(dt)  # Sqrt of dt
    for t in range(1, M + 1):
        ran = np.dot(cho_matrix, rand[:, t])
        v[t] = np.maximum(
            0,
            v[t - 1]
            + kappa * (theta - v[t - 1]) * dt
            + np.sqrt(v[t - 1]) * sigma * ran[row] * sdt,
        )
    return v
```

Next, let's implement the classic **stochastic equation** for the underlying asset price evolution:

```python
def Heston_paths(S0, r, v, row, cho_matrix):
    S = np.zeros((M + 1, Ite), dtype=float)
    S[0] = S0
    sdt = np.sqrt(dt)
    for t in range(1, M + 1, 1):
        ran = np.dot(cho_matrix, rand[:, t])
        S[t] = S[t - 1] * np.exp((r - 0.5 * v[t]) * dt + np.sqrt(v[t]) * ran[row] * sdt)

    return S
```

The last function we will define, just for simplifying the tasks, will be a **random number generator** following a standard normal:

```python
def random_number_gen(M, Ite):
    rand = np.random.standard_normal((2, M + 1, Ite))
    return rand
```

Now that we have defined the main functions to use in the process, let's implement the Heston model under some parameters (assume these are given for now):

```python
v0 = 0.04
kappa_v = 2
sigma_v = 0.3
theta_v = 0.04
rho = -0.9

S0 = 100  # Current underlying asset price
r = 0.05  # Risk-free rate
M0 = 50  # Number of time steps in a year
T = 1  # Number of years
M = int(M0 * T)  # Total time steps
Ite = 10000  # Number of simulations
dt = T / M  # Length of time step
```

Finally, let's work on the random number generator and the covariance matrix (using Cholesky decomposition to account for correlation between $dZ_1$ and $dZ_2$):

```python
# Generating random numbers from standard normal
rand = random_number_gen(M, Ite)

# Covariance Matrix
covariance_matrix = np.zeros((2, 2), dtype=np.float)
covariance_matrix[0] = [1.0, rho]
covariance_matrix[1] = [rho, 1.0]
cho_matrix = np.linalg.cholesky(covariance_matrix)
```

Now we have all the ingredients to generate the paths for both asset price and its volatility:

```python
# Volatility process paths
V = SDE_vol(v0, kappa_v, theta_v, sigma_v, T, M, Ite, rand, 1, cho_matrix)

# Underlying price process paths
S = Heston_paths(S0, r, V, 0, cho_matrix)
```

Let's visualize some of the paths for both the underlying price and the volatility:

```python
def plot_paths(n):
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(18, 6))
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121)
    ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122)

    ax1.plot(range(len(S)), S[:, :n])
    ax1.grid()
    ax1.set_title("Heston Price paths")
    ax1.set_ylabel("Price")
    ax1.set_xlabel("Timestep")

    ax2.plot(range(len(V)), V[:, :n])
    ax2.grid()
    ax2.set_title("Heston Volatility paths")
    ax2.set_ylabel("Volatility")
    ax2.set_xlabel("Timestep")

plot_paths(100)
```

## Statistical Distribution Produced by Heston

One important feature of the Heston model is that it produces a distribution of returns that has **heavier tails and kurtosis** than a normal distribution, just as we observe in practice.

In the following code snippet, we will check the Heston-produced distribution on two fronts:

1. Whether **underlying returns** resemble a Normal distribution, as assumed in BS and GBM process.

2. How **volatility** fits a mean-reverting process such as CIR or Vasicek.

```python
# Obtaining degrees of freedom (do not worry a lot about this now)
c = 2 * kappa_v / ((1 - np.exp(-kappa_v * T)) * sigma_v**2)
df = 4 * kappa_v * theta_v / sigma_v**2
nc = 2 * c * v0 * np.exp(-kappa_v * T)


# Calculating returns and lengths of axis
log_R = np.log(S[-1, :] / S0)
x = np.linspace(log_R.min(), log_R.max(), 500)
y = np.linspace(0.00001, 0.1, 500)


# Plotting the different distributions
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(16, 5))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121)
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122)

# Heston stochastic vol follows a CIR/Vasicek process
ax1.plot(
    y,
    ss.ncx2.pdf(y, df, nc, scale=1 / (2 * c)),
    color="green",
    label="non-central-chi-squared",
)
ax1.hist(V[-1, :], density=True, bins=100, facecolor="LightBlue", label="Heston Vol")
ax1.legend()
ax1.set_title("Heston Vol vs CIR")
ax1.set_xlabel("Volatility")

# Heston underlying returns do not follow a normal distribution
ax2.plot(
    x,
    ss.norm.pdf(x, log_R.mean(), log_R.std(ddof=0)),
    color="r",
    label="Normal density",
)
ax2.hist(
    log_R,
    density=True,
    bins=100,
    facecolor="LightBlue",
    label="Heston Underlying Log-returns",
)
ax2.legend()
ax2.set_title("Heston vs. Normally distributed returns")
ax2.set_xlabel("Log-returns")
```

In the previous graphs, you can observe the fit (and no-fit) of the different distributions produced to known distributions assumed in other models.

## Conclusion

Well done! Now you know a lot more about how to implement the Heston model in Python. Arguably, one thing we have not yet covered explicitly is pricing in the Heston framework. This is exactly what we will do soon.
