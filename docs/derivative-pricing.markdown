Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset. These could be stocks, indices, commodities, currencies, exchange rates, or the rate of interest. These financial instruments help you make profits by betting on the future value of the underlying asset. They are complex financial instruments that are used for various purposes including hedging, access to inaccessible markets or commodities, and generating leverage.

## 1. [Binomial Model](/derivative_pricing/2023/08/07/binomial_model)

When it comes to pricing options, understanding the binomial tree model is crucial. In this article, we'll discuss how this model operates and demonstrate how to implement it using Python.

## 2. [Put-Call parity](/derivative_pricing/2023/08/07/put_call_parity)

Put-Call Parity ensures balance in the options market. If the relationship wasn't in balance, it would offer arbitrage opportunities which are essentially "free money" strategies - something markets tend to correct quickly.

## 3. [Introducing Delta](/derivative_pricing/2023/08/09/introducing_delta)

We'll introduce the concept of delta hedging, a strategy used to hedge against price movements in the underlying asset.

## 4. [Calibrating the Binomial Model](/derivative_pricing/2023/08/15/calibrating_binomial)

Calibrating the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM) using the underlying asset's volatility.

## 5. [Dynamic Delta Hedging with American Options](/derivative_pricing/2023/08/16/american_options)

An American option gives its holder the right to exercise the option at any point in time, up until its expiration. This early exercise feature significantly impacts not only the option's price, but also the strategy we use to hedge the option.

## 6. [Monte Carlo Methods intro](/derivative_pricing/2023/08/16/monte_carlo_methods)

At its core, the Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that allows us to approximate complex mathematical problems using random sampling.
